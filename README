This is the octave implementation of a very basic version of speed profile generator. 
It takes as input the length of moving object, length of tracks (edges/roads in the network),
varying speed limits along the tracks/edges/roads, varying acceleration/deceleration profiles
and calculates the most optimal speed profile to cover the distance in shortest time also 
given the boundary conditions - entry and exit speed.

I call it forward-iterative because its part of a bigger solver that also takes into account
blocking constraints - like if the roads/tracks are already completely occupied, then its 
taken into account too - but the solver only iterates from the start to the end (hence forward).
There is no backtracking in the full blown solver.
